First of all team leaders create a repository, add team members and push the starter code from NetBeans to it. Then all team members
start working on the code by pulling, pushing, committing through NetBeans. Starter Code has four classes namely Card.java,
GroupOfCards.java, Player.java, Game.java in ca.sheridancollege.project package.
Card class will contain the main method, all calling statements to other methods in different classes and printing statements.
The game class will contain various methods in reference to the rules of the game.
GroupOfCards class will contain a shuffle method which changes the indexes of random pairs of cards in the deck.
Player class will contain getters, setters and toString methods.
Our team will be using NetBeans for writing code and Visual Paradigm for creating UML diagrams.
